# ID-ASG2
Assignment 2
So I wanted to do something that I had never done before. Thus I created a horizontal scroll page. I also wanted the design of this website to be very clean and spotless yet modern.

#Astir
Astir, a recipe sourcing website
- Showcases a recipe sourcing API that allows users to search for over 2 million recipes
- Allows users to create an account 
- Allows them to save notes in their notes section.
- Dark mode so that the user will be able to read in comfort
- 
One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
 
## Design Process
- Created for people who are uncertain of what to eat for breakfast lunch and dinner and do not know where and how to source for recipes.
- This is for people who want to become healthier by cooking at home
- Has a fun design so that people will look forward to using the website and thus feel motivated to cook at home.
- Allows users to keep a notes section so that the data will be saved the next time they return to the page.

Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

As a user, I would like to get recipes of food so that I can cook at home.

As a user, I would like to have a pleasant user experience while going through the webpage 


In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

## Features

- A saved recipes tab that displays all the recipes
- Gamefication system that awards the user badges when they save a certain number of badges.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap** to create responsive elements.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - The project uses the sun and moon icons from **Fontawesome** for the dark mode toggle.




## Testing
1. Dark-mode toggle
   1. Go to every-page one after another
   2. Click onto the white ball in the toggle
   3. The ball should move to the other side to reveal the moon icon and the color scheme of the webpage should become dark and have some contrast.

2. Log in form on first page
   1. Go to home page,
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
